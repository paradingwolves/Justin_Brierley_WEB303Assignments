                                    <img src="img/ricky.jpg" alt="Ricky">
                                    <p>Richard LeFleur was born March 21, 1971, in the region of Nova Scotia, Canada, to Tammy LaFleur and his unnamed father, who Tammy had a one night stand with, while married to Ray. His mother left Sunnyvale soon after he was born. He was raised by an alcoholic trucker, Raymond “Ray” LaFleur who once accidentally locked himself with Ricky in a meat freezer for “seven hours”. Ricky grew up in Sunnyvale Trailer Park. When he was a kid, he became friends with Julian and Bubbles. </p>
                                    <p>In his early teens, Ricky started growing sideburns and everyone started calling him “Reveen”. He had to repeat grade 6, three times due to being heavily intoxicated. In grade 7, Ricky lost an entire crop of weed to dope-eating insects.[2] When he was 13, Ricky was spanked by Ray in front of the entire park due to using his car.[3] He never graduated from high school, due to dropping out of during grade ten. In the early 1990s, Ricky begin a relationship with Lucy (who used to date Julian) and the two later had a daughter, Trinity LeFleur. </p>

                                    <p>I'd like to use this section to congratulate Ricky on getting his grade 10! Ricky made it a personal
                                    goal to get his grade 10. Having his grade 10 will make people realize that he is as smart as him and take
                                    him more seriously. Ricky almost gets kicked out for Smoking during the final exam, but luckily he passed
                                    with (for his standards) flying carpets, a 57%! Good job, <strong>Ricky!</strong> Now that Ricky has his grade
                                    10, he is now at least as smart as everyone else.

                                    <p>It is Ricky's life motto to never work. Ricky states once or twice that he has never worked at a real job, but in fact he has had three bona fide jobs: a brief stint as a mall cop, he works as the Temporary Relief Assistant Park Supervisor, then as the Park Supervisor. He also worked as a janitor at the local vocational school (although is it basically a front to sell drugs to the students and faculty). Also, towards Season 12, Ricky offers himself as a handyman, although that does not last very long as he destroys Margeurite's bathroom, initially hired to install a towel rack. He also worked as pest control for the park.</p>

They hook up again after Ricky gets out of jail.</p>

The next time we see him, he is being released from jail and he states he has nowhere to go until Julian allows him to sleep in his car in his driveway. (It is thought at this point that Lucy had kicked him out again for going to jail), which Julian later gives to Ricky outright. Ricky lives in this car during most of his time in Sunnyvale.</p>

                            <h3>Freedom 35</h3>
                            <p>The boys have just spent 18 months in jail on firearms charges, so understandibly they have 
                            plans in place to ensure this doesn't happen again. Now even more understandibly, this plan will
                            be funded by stealing and flipping car stereos. The idea behind this plan is to commit low level 
                            crimes and reinvest in their equipment while continuing to commit larger crimes until they can
                            commit the "Big Dirty". The "Big Dirty" is a metaphor they use for the crime they'll eventually
                            commit that's big enough for them to retire on the returns. Foolproof if you ask me.
